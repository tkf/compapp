   TBE
   to be extended

     Methods and properties marked as *to be extended* or *TBE* may be
     overridden (extended) by user-defined subclasses to implement
     certain functionalities.  Note that the override is completely
     optional as oppose to abstract methods and properties which are
     required to be overridden by subclasses.  In Python code,
     docstrings for such methods and properties are prefixed with
     ``|TO BE EXTENDED|``.
